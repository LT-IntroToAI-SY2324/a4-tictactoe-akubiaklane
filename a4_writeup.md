# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
I couldn't really figure out how to check who won.
When I was trying it I first tried to use lists and gave up.

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

The computer would have random inputs so it would'nt be the best player. The computer would keep choosing a spot until it finds an empty one.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

The computer would first check if it has any chances to win, and then place there. If not, then
it would check if the other player has any possible wins and stop them. If there isn't anything like that then the computer would try to place next to where it already has some. I have no idea how this would be coded, though.
